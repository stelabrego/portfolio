You are here! This is my personal website that I've had running since 2017. It's gone through major changes but the most recent iteration was created in the beginning of 2019. The site is made using the wonderful Hugo static site generator.

I revamped this site in 2019 because I wanted to create a completely custom Hugo site. The previous iteration was using a heavily modified theme. This time, I dug into the Hugo docs and created something completely custom for me.

I started by designing the site. What content did I want to put on here? I realized I wanted the site to be a place to show off all the cool projects I'm constantly working on. I put them into the categories Art, Code, and Organizing. I also wanted to advertise my tutoring services so I included that as well. Those categories went in the navbar. I decided Art and Code should have their own "posts" because they have a lot of individual projects within them. Organizing and Tutoring are single pages.

I love designing websites and I'm especially fond of early 2000's internet design gore, so I decided to embrace that aesthetic on my site, hence the spinning picture of myself and the slanted, abrasive navbar. I'm very focused on a mobile-first approach so when I design I try to make the website look good on iPhone 5 up to a large desktop.

I'm a big fan of the Masonry Layout JS library so I used that on the Art page to display my works. I also used a Github Activity JS widget on my Code page, and I used a Medium Activity JS widget on my homepage. I love using widgets that keep your site content fresh with my activity.

To top it all off, I'm using Netlify CMS on this site to provide an **amazing** backend for updating the content here. The site is hosted on Netlify and I just had to add a couple scripts and adjust some Netlify settings to get a CMS that actually commits to my Github repo and triggers rebuilds when new content is added. This way, I have a very beautiful UI to work with instead of raw markdown and terminal commands, and I also can add content from any browser in the world. Thank you Netlify. ðŸ’•

Building this website taught me a lot about Hugo, and it has made me feel more confident with CSS and JS too. I'm very happy with it! Thanks for visiting.
