I'm available for tutoring for general computer science related topics.

* Assistance with computer science related schoolwork
* Front-end web development w/ HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Software development essentials with PHP, Python, or Java

I've taken the following classes at the college level:

* Intro to Programming w/ Java
* Intro to Programming w/ Python
* Advanced Java
* Java Server Programming
* Android Development w/ Java
* PHP, Apache, & MySQL

I've also completed numerous online courses and challenges on codecademy.com, lynda.com, and hackerrank.com and I've worked on various side projects you can find in the "Code" section of this website.

Basically what I'm saying is...

**I can code. And I really like teaching other people how to code too!**

If you are interested in learning how to code, it can be a wonderful idea to try some tutoring sessions. There's so much jargon and confusion as a beginner and having someone beside you to guide you along, especially during those first steps can be a game changer.
